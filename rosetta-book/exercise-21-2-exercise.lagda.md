## Problem statement

<div class="subexenum">

Show that the circle is connected.

Let `P:S^1→Prop` be a family of propositions over the circle.
Show that
```text
P(base)→Π(x:S^1) P(x).
```

Show that any embedding `m:S^1→S^1` is an equivalence.

Show that for any embedding `m:X→S^1`, there is a proposition `P` and an equivalence `e:X ≃ S^1× P` for which the triangle

          [S^1]

Arrows:

- X --e--> S^1× P
- S^1× P --pr 1--> S^1

commutes.
In other words, all the embeddings into the circle are of the form `S^1× P→ S^1`.
