<!-- rosetta-item: section-1.3 -->

We are now ready to present the system of inference rules that underlies dependent type theory.
These rules are known as the **structural rules** of type theory, since they establish the basic mathematical framework for type dependency.
There are six sets of inference rules:

1.  Rules about the formation of contexts, types, and their elements

2.  Rules postulating that judgmental equality is an equivalence relation.

3.  Variable conversion rules.

4.  Substitution rules.

5.  Weakening rules.

6.  The generic element.

### Rules about the formation of contexts, types, and their elements

<!-- rosetta-item: subheading-1.3-rules-about-the-formation-of-contexts-types-and-their-elements -->

In the definition of well-formed contexts, types, and elements we specified that for a type `B(x)` to be well-formed in context `Γ,x:A`, it must be the case that `A` is a well-formed type in context `Γ`.
The following rules follow from the presuppositions about contexts, types, and their elements, and may be used freely in derivations:

### Judgmental equality is an equivalence relation

<!-- rosetta-item: subheading-1.3-judgmental-equality-is-an-equivalence-relation -->

The rules postulating that judgmental equality on types and on elements is an equivalence relation simply postulate that these relations are reflexive, symmetric, and transitive:

```

### Variable conversion rules

<!-- rosetta-item: subheading-1.3-variable-conversion-rules -->

The **variable conversion rules** are rules postulating that we can convert the type of a variable to a judgmentally equal type.
The first variable conversion rule states that

<!-- rosetta-proof-tree: 4e63e5f67887; review: pending -->

*Proof tree (automatic faithful draft).*

```text
Γ⊢ A≐ A' \textrm{type}   Γ, x:A, \Delta⊢ B(x) \type
───────────────────────────────────────────────────
           $Γ, x:A', \Delta⊢ B(x) \type$
```

In this conversion rule, the context `Γ, x:A, \Delta` is just any extension of the context `Γ, x:A`, i.e., it is a context of the form
```text
x_1:A_1, …, x_{n-1}:A_{n-1}, x:A, x_{n+1}:A_{n+1}, …, x_{n+m}:A_{n+m}.
```

Similarly, there are variable conversion rules for judgmental equality of types, for elements, and for judgmental equality of elements.
To avoid having to state essentially the same rule four times, we state all four variable conversion rules at once using a *generic judgment thesis* `J`, which can be any of the four kinds described in Definition 1.1.1:

<!-- rosetta-proof-tree: 3d87bb94a29d; review: pending -->

*Proof tree (automatic faithful draft).*

```text
Γ⊢ A≐ A' \textrm{type}   Γ, x:A, \Delta⊢ J
──────────────────────────────────────────
           $Γ, x:A', \Delta⊢ J$
```

An analogous *element conversion rule*, stated in Exercise 1.1, converting the type of an element to a judgmentally equal type, is derivable using the rules from the rules presented in this section.

### Substitution

<!-- rosetta-item: subheading-1.3-substitution -->

Consider an element `f(x):B(x)` indexed by `x:A` in context `Γ`, and suppose we also have an element `a:A`.
Then we can simultaneously substitute `a` for all occurrences of `x` in `f(x)` to obtain a new element `f[a/x]`, which has type `B[a/x]`.
A precise definition of substitution requires us to get too deep into the theory of the syntax of type theory, but a mathematician is of course no stranger to substitution.
For example, substituting `0` for `x` in the polynomial
```text
1+x+x^2+x^3
```
results in the number `1+0+0^2+0^3`, which can be computed to the value `1`.

Type theoretic substitution is similar.
Type theoretic substitution is in fact a bit more general than what we have described above.
Suppose we have a type
```text
Γ, x:A, y_{1}:B_{1}, …, y_{n}:B_{n}⊢ C \textrm{type}
```
and an element `a:A` in context `Γ`.
Then we can simultaneously substitute `a` for all occurrences of `x` in the types `B_1,…,B_n` and `C`, to obtain
```text
Γ, y_{1}:B_{1}[a/x], …, y_{n}:B_{n}[a/x]⊢ C[a/x] type.
```
Note that the variables `y_{1}, …,y_{n}` are assigned new types after performing the substitution of `a` for `x`.
Similarly, we can substitute `a` for `x` in an element `c:C` to obtain the element `c[a/x]:C[a/x]`, and we can substitute `a` for `x` in a judgmental equality thesis, either of types or elements, by simply substituting on both sides of the equation.
The **substitution rule** are therefore stated using a generic judgment `J`:

<!-- rosetta-proof-tree: 5feebee835f4; review: pending -->

*Proof tree (automatic faithful draft).*

```text
Γ⊢ a:A   Γ, x:A, \Delta⊢ J
────────────────────────── $S$
  Γ, \Delta[a/x]⊢ J[a/x]
```

Furthermore, we add two more ‘congruence rules’ for substitution, postulating that substitution by judgmentally equal elements results in judgmentally equal types and elements:

<!-- rosetta-proof-tree: 87332bdd668a; review: pending -->

*Proof tree (automatic faithful draft).*

```text
 Γ⊢ a≐ a':A   Γ, x:A, \Delta⊢ B \type
─────────────────────────────────────
Γ, \Delta[a/x]⊢ B[a/x]≐ B[a'/x] \type
```

<!-- rosetta-proof-tree: dbddef295494; review: pending -->

*Proof tree (automatic faithful draft).*

```text
    Γ⊢ a≐ a':A   Γ, x:A, \Delta⊢ b:B
────────────────────────────────────────
$Γ, \Delta[a/x]⊢ b[a/x]≐ b[a'/x]:B[a/x]$
```

To see that these rules make sense, we observe that both `B[a/x]` and `B[a'/x]` are types in context `\Delta[a/x]`, provided that `a≐ a'`.
This is immediate by recursion on the length of `\Delta`.

## Definition 1.3.1

<!-- rosetta-item: definition-1.3.1 -->

When `B` is a family of types over `A` in context `Γ`, and if we have `a:A`, then we also say that `B[a/x]` is the **fiber** of `B` at `a`.
We will usually write `B(a)` for the fiber of `B` at `a`.

When `b` is a section of the family `B` over `A` in context `Γ`, we call the element `b[a/x]` the **value** of `b` at `a`.
Again, we will usually write `b(a)` for the value of `b` at `a`.

### Weakening

<!-- rosetta-item: subheading-1.3-weakening -->

If we are given a type `A` in context `Γ`, then any judgment made in a longer context `Γ, \Delta` can also be made in the context `Γ, x:A, \Delta`, for a fresh variable `x`.
The **weakening rule** asserts that weakening by a type `A` in context preserves well-formedness and judgmental equality of types and elements.

<!-- rosetta-proof-tree: 465ac8b83ef4; review: pending -->

*Proof tree (automatic faithful draft).*

```text
Γ⊢ A \textrm{type}   Γ, \Delta⊢ J
───────────────────────────────── $W$
        Γ, x:A, \Delta ⊢ J
```

This process of expanding the context by a fresh variable of type `A` is called **weakening** (by `A`).

In the simplest situation where weakening applies, we have two types `A` and `B` in context `Γ`.
Then we can weaken `B` by `A` as follows

<!-- rosetta-proof-tree: 7bd204629420; review: pending -->

*Proof tree (automatic faithful draft).*

```text
Γ⊢ A \textrm{type}   Γ⊢ B \textrm{type}
─────────────────────────────────────── W
            Γ, x:A⊢ B \type
```

in order to form the type `B` in context `Γ, x:A`.
The type `B` in context `Γ, x:A` is called the **constant family** `B`, or the **trivial family** `B`.

### The generic elements

<!-- rosetta-item: subheading-1.3-the-generic-elements -->

If we are given a type `A` in context `Γ`, then we can weaken `A` by itself to obtain that `A` is a type in context `Γ, x:A`.
The rule for the **generic element** now asserts that any hypothetical element `x:A` in the context `Γ, x:A` is also an element of type `A` in context `Γ, x:A`.

<!-- rosetta-proof-tree: d736546ee40a; review: pending -->

*Proof tree (automatic faithful draft).*

```text
Γ⊢ A \textrm{type}
────────────────── $\delta$
   Γ, x:A⊢ x:A
```

This rule is also known as the **variable rule**.
One of the reasons for including the generic element is to make sure that the variables declared in a context—i.e., the hypothetical elements—are indeed *elements*.
It also provides the *identity function* on the type `A` in context `Γ`.
