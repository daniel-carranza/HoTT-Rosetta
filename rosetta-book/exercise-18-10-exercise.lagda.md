## Problem statement

A map `f:A → B` is called **weakly path-constant** if it comes equipped with an element of type
```text
is-weakly-path-constant(f) : Π(x,y:A) Π(p,q:x=y) ap_{f}(p)=ap_{f}(q).
```
In other words, `f` is weakly path-constant if for each `x,y:A` the map `ap{f}:(x=y)→ (f(x)=f(y))` is weakly constant in the sense of Definition 14.4.3.

<div class="subexenum">

Show that every map `‖A‖_0→ B` is weakly path-constant.
Use this to obtain a map
```text
α : (‖A‖_0→ B)→(Σ(f:A→ B) is-weakly-path-constant(f)).
```

Show that if `B` is a `1`-type, then the map `α` is an equivalence.
In other words, show that every weakly path-constant map `f:A→ B` into a `1`-type `B` has a unique extension
