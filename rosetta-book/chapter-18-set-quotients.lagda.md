In this section we construct the quotient of a type by an equivalence relation.
By an equivalence relation we understand a binary relation `R` which is reflexive, symmetric, transitive, and moreover, we require that the type `R(x,y)` relating `x` and `y` is a proposition.
Therefore, if `𝒰` is a universe that contains `R(x,y)` for each `x,y:A`, then we can view `R` as a map
```text
R:A→(A→Prop_𝒰).
```
The quotient `A/R` is constructed as the type of equivalence classes, which is just the image of the map `R:A→ (A→Prop_𝒰)`.
This construction of the quotient by an equivalence relation is very much like the construction of a quotient set in classical set theory.
Examples of set quotients are abundant in mathematics.
We cover two of them in this section: the type of rational numbers and the set truncation of a type.

There is, however, a subtle issue with our construction of the set quotient as the image of the map `R:A→(A→Prop_𝒰)`.
What universe is the quotient `A/R` in?
Note that `Prop_𝒰` is a type in the successor universe `𝒰^+`, constructed in Definition 6.2.3.
Therefore the function type `A→ Prop_𝒰` as well as the quotient `A/R` are also types in `𝒰^+`.
That seems unfortunate, because in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory the quotient of a set by an equivalence relation is an ordinary set, and not a more general class.

To address the size issues of set quotients, we will introduce the type theoretic replacement axiom.
This axiom is analogous to the replacement axiom in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, which asserts that the image of a set under any function is again a set.
The type theoretic replacement property asserts that for any map `f:A→ B` from a type `A` in `𝒰` to a type `B` of which the *identity types* are equivalent to types in `𝒰`, the image of `f` is also equivalent to a type in `𝒰`.
The replacement axiom can either be assumed, or it can be proven from the assumption that universes are closed under certain *higher inductive types*, and it is therefore considered to be a very mild assumption.
