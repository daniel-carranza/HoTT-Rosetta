The image of a map `f:A→ X` can be thought of as the least subtype of `X` that contains all the values of `f`.
More precisely, the image of `f` is an embedding `i:im(f)↪ X` that fits in a commuting triangle

and satisfies the *universal property* of the image of `f`, which states that if a subtype `B↪ X` contains all the values of `f`, then it contains the image of `f`.
