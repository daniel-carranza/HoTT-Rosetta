## Problem statement

Construct for any map `f:A→ B` an equivalence `e:A ≃ Σ(y:B) fib(f, y)` and a homotopy `H:f~ pr 1∘ e` witnessing that the triangle

commutes.
The projection `pr 1 : (Σ(y:B) fib(f, y))→ B` is sometimes also called the **fibrant replacement** of `f`, because first projection maps are fibrations in the homotopy interpretation of type theory.
