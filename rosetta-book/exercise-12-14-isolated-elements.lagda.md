# Exercise 12.14

```agda
module exercise-12-14-isolated-elements where

```

## Problem statement

Consider a type `A` equipped with an element `a:A`.
We say that `a` is an **isolated element** of `A` if it comes equipped with an element of type
```text
is-isolated(a)≔Π(x:A) (a=x)+(a≠ x).
```

<div class="subexenum">

Show that `a` is isolated if and only if the map `const_a:unit→ A` has decidable fibers.

Show that if `a` is isolated, then `a=x` is a proposition, for every `x:A`.
Conclude that if `a` is isolated, then the map `const_a:unit→ A` is an embedding.
