## Problem statement

Consider two types `A` and `B`.
The **Stirling type of the second kind** is the type
```text
Stirling(A, B):=Σ(X:𝒰_B) A↠ X.
```

<div class="subexenum">

Show that if `B` is a `k`-type, then the type `Stirling(A, B)` is also a `k`-type.

Suppose that `B` has decidable equality.
Construct an equivalence
```text
Stirling(A+unit, B+unit)≃ (B+unit)×Stirling(A, B+unit)+Stirling(A, B)
```

Suppose that `A` and `B` are finite types of cardinality `n` and `k`.
Show that the Stirling type `Stirling(A, B)` of the second kind is a finite type of cardinality `Stirling(n, k)`, where `Stirling(n, k)` is the **Stirling number of the second kind**.
