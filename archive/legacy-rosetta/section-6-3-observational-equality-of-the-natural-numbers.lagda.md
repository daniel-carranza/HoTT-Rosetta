Using universes, we can define many relations on the natural numbers.
We give here the example of *observational equality* of `ℕ`.
The idea of observational equality is that, if we want to prove that `m` and
`n` are observationally equal, we may do so by looking at `m` and `n`:

1. If both `m` and `n` are `0`, then they are observationally equal.
2. If one of them is `0` and the other is a successor, then they are not
observationally equal.
3. If both `m` and `n` are successors, say `m ≐ succ(m')` and
`n ≐ succ(n')`, then `m` and `n` are observationally equal if and only if their
predecessors `m'` and `n'` are observationally equal.

Thus, observational equality is an inductively defined relation, which gives us
an algorithm for checking equality on `ℕ`.
Indeed, it can be used to show that equality of natural numbers is *decidable*,
i.e., there is a program that decides for any two natural numbers `m` and `n`
whether they are equal or not.

## Definition 6.3.1

We define the **observational equality** of `ℕ` as binary relation
`Eq-ℕ : ℕ → (ℕ → 𝕌₀)` satisfying

```text
  Eq-ℕ(0, 0)       ≐ 𝟙      Eq-ℕ(succ(n), 0)       ≐ ∅
  Eq-ℕ(0, succ(n)) ≐ ∅      Eq-ℕ(succ(n), succ(m)) ≐ Eq-ℕ(n, m).
```

## Construction

We define `Eq-ℕ` by double induction on `ℕ`.
By the first application of induction it suffices to provide

```text
  E₀ : ℕ → 𝕌₀
  Eₛ : ℕ → ((ℕ → 𝕌₀) → (ℕ → 𝕌₀)).
```

We define `E₀` by induction, taking `E₀₀ := 𝟙` and
`E₀ₛ(n, X, m) := ∅`.
The resulting family `E₀` satisfies

```text
  E₀(0)       ≐ 𝟙
  E₀(succ(n)) ≐ ∅.
```

We define `Eₛ` by induction, taking `Eₛ₀ := ∅` and `Eₛₛ(n, X, m) := X(m)`.
The resulting family `Eₛ` satisfies

```text
  Eₛ(n, X, 0)       ≐ ∅
  Eₛ(n, X, succ(m)) ≐ X(m).
```

Therefore we have by the computation rule for the first induction that the
judgmental equality

```text
  Eq-ℕ(0, m)       ≐ E₀(m)
  Eq-ℕ(succ(n), m) ≐ Eₛ(n, Eq-ℕ(n), m)
```

holds, from which the judgmental equalities in the statement of the definition
follow.

```agda
Eq-ℕ : ℕ → ℕ → UU lzero
Eq-ℕ zero-ℕ zero-ℕ = unit
Eq-ℕ zero-ℕ (succ-ℕ n) = empty
Eq-ℕ (succ-ℕ m) zero-ℕ = empty
Eq-ℕ (succ-ℕ m) (succ-ℕ n) = Eq-ℕ m n
```

The observational equality of the natural numbers is important because it can be
used to prove equalities and negations of equalities.
The following proposition enables us to do so.

## Lemma 6.3.2

Observational equality of `ℕ` is a reflexive relation, i.e., we have

```text
  refl-Eq-ℕ : Π(n : ℕ) Eq-ℕ(n, n).
```

## Proof

The function `refl-Eq-ℕ` is defined by induction on `n`, taking

```text
  refl-Eq-ℕ(0)       := ⋆
  refl-Eq-ℕ(succ(n)) := refl-Eq-ℕ(n).
```

```agda
refl-Eq-ℕ : (n : ℕ) → Eq-ℕ n n
refl-Eq-ℕ zero-ℕ = star
refl-Eq-ℕ (succ-ℕ n) = refl-Eq-ℕ n
```

## Proposition 6.3.3

For any two natural numbers `m` and `n`, we have

```text
  (m = n) ↔ Eq-ℕ(m, n).
```

## Proof

The function `(m = n) → Eq-ℕ(m, n)` is defined by the induction principle of
identity types, using the reflexivity of `Eq-ℕ`.

The converse `Eq-ℕ(m, n) → (m = n)` is defined by induction on `m` and `n`.
If both `m` and `n` are zero, we have `refl(0) : 0 = 0`.
If one of `m` and `n` is zero and the other is a successor, then `Eq-ℕ(m, n)` is
empty and we have a function `∅ → (m = n)` by the induction principle of the
empty type.
In the inductive step, suppose we have a function `f : Eq-ℕ(m, n) → (m = n)`.
Then we can define a function

```text
  Eq-ℕ(succ(m), succ(n)) → (succ(m) = succ(n))
```

as the composite

```text
  Eq-ℕ(succ(m), succ(n)) → Eq-ℕ(m, n) → (m = n) → (succ(m) = succ(n)).
```

Note that the map on the left is the identity function, because we have the
judgmental equality `Eq-ℕ(succ(m), succ(n)) ≐ Eq-ℕ(m, n)` by definition of
`Eq-ℕ`.

```agda
Eq-eq-ℕ : {x y : ℕ} → x ＝ y → Eq-ℕ x y
Eq-eq-ℕ {x} {.x} refl = refl-Eq-ℕ x

eq-Eq-ℕ : (x y : ℕ) → Eq-ℕ x y → x ＝ y
eq-Eq-ℕ zero-ℕ zero-ℕ e = refl
eq-Eq-ℕ (succ-ℕ x) (succ-ℕ y) e = ap succ-ℕ (eq-Eq-ℕ x y e)
```
