# Section Agda audit

Historical audit evidence through 2026-09-07. Under the September 11 policy,
the accepted proposal solutions are shared maintained content; former empty
main sites and branch restrictions below are superseded. Do not regenerate
files or restore holes based on this record. The old book/ directory is now
latex-book/. Current maintained-file checks and mathematical coverage must be
assessed separately; consult implementation-handoff.md and conversion-contract.md.

Audited against the LaTeX, generated prose, and curated declarations, not file
presence or review state. Source locations and hashes are in the block
manifests at pinned commit `c85d7fb834778f96a66576318cdc4ef3d4b80a26`.
The completion list contains only sections with all required mathematics and
passing candidate checks on `main`. Deferred sections remain outside it.

## Chapter 10 (2026-09-06)

All 19 numbered items and their adjacent proofs/constructions in
`book/contractible.tex` are present in the generated sections. The contraction,
singleton induction, fiber, and coherent inverse proofs were compared to the
stored upstream excerpts. Known choices are recorded below.

| Item | Formalization and coverage |
| --- | --- |
| Definition 10.1.1 | `is-contr`, `center`, and `contraction`; the upstream normalized contraction also supplies `coh-contraction`. |
| Remark 10.1.2 | No separate Agda declaration is needed: expanding homotopy, constant function, and identity gives exactly `(x : A) → c ＝ x`. This is a judgmental restatement of the contraction type, not an additional path equality. |
| Example 10.1.3 | `is-contr-unit`, including the center and contraction. |
| Theorem 10.1.4 | `is-contr-Id`, the center and path-induction contraction of the total path space. The upstream `is-torsorial` abbreviation is expanded to contractibility of the dependent sum. |
| Definition 10.2.1 | Empty training site on `main`; definition, induction operator, and computation rule restored on proposal `511f171`, with evaluation at Remark 2.2.2. |
| Example 10.2.2 | Requires Agda: `is-singleton-unit` packages `ind-unit` and `refl-htpy`. Adapted from the total-path singleton example, preserving its two-field construction and computation proof. Checked on proposal `511f171`. |
| Theorem 10.2.3 | `ind-singleton`, `compute-ind-singleton`, and both directions `is-singleton-is-contr` / `is-contr-is-singleton`; checked on proposal `511f171`. |
| Definition 10.3.1 | `fiber`, with both projections; `fiber'` is the upstream opposite-path variant. |
| Definition 10.3.2 | `Eq-fiber`, reflexivity, the canonical map, and its inverse by pair/path induction. The upstream second path is `ap f α ∙ p' ＝ p`, the inverse orientation of the book's `p ＝ ap f α ∙ p'`. |
| Proposition 10.3.3 | `is-section-eq-Eq-fiber`, `is-retraction-eq-Eq-fiber`, `is-equiv-Eq-eq-fiber`, and the packaged equivalence. This excerpt continues the anonymous module begun at Definition 10.3.2. |
| Definition 10.3.4 | `is-contr-map`, contractibility of each fiber. |
| Theorem 10.3.5 | Inverse from fiber centers, section from the second projection, retraction from the first projection of a path in the fiber, then `is-equiv-is-contr-map`. |
| Definition 10.4.1 | Coherent inverse quadruple, projections, and underlying inverse. |
| Proposition 10.4.2 | Center and contraction of each fiber, then `is-contr-map-is-coherently-invertible`. |
| Definition 10.4.3 | `nat-htpy`; the upstream equation is the inverse orientation of the book's naturality equation. |
| Definition 10.4.4 | `nat-htpy-id` alone is only the intermediate naturality equation. The actual cancellation result `coh-htpy-id` is supplied here on proposal `5e5a5cd` as part of the recorded Lemma 10.4.5 exercise; it remains absent on `main`. |
| Lemma 10.4.5 | Empty on `main`; the adjusted section and higher coherence are proved on proposal `5e5a5cd`, retained and rechecked at `511f171`. |
| Theorem 10.4.6 | Composition of the preceding implications, checked on the proposal because of Lemma 10.4.5. |
| Corollary 10.4.7 | `is-contr-Id'`; upstream reverse path induction proves the same claim directly, while the book uses the fiber of the identity equivalence. |

Sections 10.1 and 10.3 pass candidate Agda checks and have complete required
coverage. Sections 10.2 and 10.4 and Chapter 10 are intentionally deferred on
`main`. Proposal `511f171` passes Sections 2.2, 10.2, and 10.4 and aggregate
Chapters 2--10. No optional reviewer decisions were transferred or refreshed.

## Section 11.1 (2026-09-06)

All six items and their proofs in `book/fundamental.tex` have curated code.
The main source is `foundation-core/functoriality-dependent-pair-types`, with
the separate fiberwise-equivalence predicate from
`foundation-core/families-of-equivalences`. Full commit, ranges, and hashes are
recorded in `data/agda-blocks-chapter-11.json`.

| Item | Formalization |
| --- | --- |
| Definition 11.1.1 | `tot`, preserving the base coordinate. |
| Lemma 11.1.2 | `compute-fiber-tot`, its forward and inverse maps, and both homotopies by pair/path induction. |
| Theorem 11.1.3 | `is-fiberwise-equiv`, both implications between it and `is-equiv (tot f)`, and `equiv-tot`. |
| Lemma 11.1.4 | `map-Σ-map-base`, its fiber equivalence, and the implications for contractible maps and equivalences. |
| Definition 11.1.5 | `map-Σ`, changing the base and fiber coordinates. |
| Theorem 11.1.6 | `triangle-map-Σ`, both equivalence implications, and `equiv-Σ`. The triangle's anonymous module is restored after splitting it from Definition 11.1.5; `map-Σ` therefore receives `D` explicitly. |

Only section dependencies were added to Exercises 9.4, 10.2, and 10.3:
triangle laws and 3-for-2, preservation of contractibility by retracts, and
3-for-2 for contractible types and equivalences. Unused parts of Exercises
9.4 and 10.3 remain explicit gaps. Section 9.2 was not a complete
formalization: Corollary 9.2.8 was blocked. Its existing source excerpt was
completed via a passing scratchpad by restoring its module and using the
section inverse proved in Proposition 9.2.7. The retract-data type belongs
with Definition 9.2.1, which already introduces that notion in the book.
No complete earlier file was enlarged and no review evidence was refreshed.

Section 9.2 and the three changed exercise candidates pass on `main`.
Section 11.1 remains deferred through Lemma 10.4.5 and is not in the
completion list. Published proposal `dc1ffed` passes candidate Sections 10.2,
10.4, and 11.1 and aggregate Chapters 9--11. Its full unit suite and repository
checks pass. The prose preserves the optional base parameter in `tot_f(g)`;
diagram spacing options are excluded from mathematical node labels. Both
conversion repairs have regression tests and were regenerated throughout the
active output.

## Section 11.2 (2026-09-06)

Both numbered items, the canonical-family specialization, and the full proof
in `book/fundamental.tex` are preserved. Seven curated blocks formalize:

| Item | Formalization |
| --- | --- |
| Definition 11.2.1 | Evaluation at the distinguished pair, the universe-level predicate, and the universe-polymorphic identity-system predicate. |
| Theorem 11.2.2, (i) iff (ii) | `fundamental-theorem-id` and its converse for arbitrary families of maps. The upstream result is stronger: neither direction needs the stipulated equation at the base point. |
| Theorem 11.2.2, (ii) iff (iii) | `is-identity-system-is-contr` specializes the pinned singleton-induction package to the dependent sum and curries its section with the existing `ev-pair`; the computation witness is unchanged. The converse is copied from `identity-systems`, with its module restored. |
| Theorem 11.2.2, canonical family | `fundamental-theorem-id-J` and its converse specialize to path induction. |

The exact upstream identity-system construction uses `is-prop-is-contr`, a
later proposition result. The analogous singleton-induction package instead
uses the book's proof route and already available local results; no missing
auxiliary proof is inserted or hidden. `is-torsorial B` is expanded to
`is-contr (Σ A B)`, and upstream `is-torsorial-Id` is the local `is-contr-Id`.
The three conditions are connected by implication functions, not asserted as
an equivalence of proof types.

The prose comparison has all four headings and nine displays, with no
unresolved references or raw TeX commands. Section 11.2 is deferred on `main`
through both recorded Chapter 10 training exercises and is not recorded
complete. Published proposal `a48a60e` passes the Section 11.2 candidate and
aggregate Chapter 11. Its unit suite (147 tests) and repository checks pass.

## Section 11.3 (2026-09-06)

Theorem 11.3.1 and its full induction proof are preserved. The pinned natural
number equality module supplies `map-total-Eq-ℕ`, the center and contraction
of `Σ ℕ (Eq-ℕ m)`, and `is-equiv-Eq-eq-ℕ` by Theorem 11.2.2. The mixed
zero/successor cases are impossible because their equality code is empty;
Agda's coverage checker handles them. The successor case uses `ap` of the
same total-space successor map as the book.

The introductory definitions and canonical map are reused from complete
Section 6.3 without changing it. Only the `is-torsorial` abbreviation is
expanded in the excerpt. Section 11.3 is deferred on `main` through both
Chapter 10 training exercises and is not recorded complete. Published proposal
`c41af9d` passes its candidate and aggregate Chapter 11, all 148 unit tests,
and repository checks. The prose comparison preserves all three headings and
eleven displays, with no unresolved references or raw TeX commands.

## Section 11.4 (2026-09-06)

Both numbered items and the complete proof are preserved.

| Item | Formalization |
| --- | --- |
| Definition 11.4.1 | `is-emb`, the type `_↪_`, its projections, and the induced equivalence on identity types. |
| Theorem 11.4.2 | Empty training block on `main`, solved on proposal `63e5e49`: specialize the pinned contractible-fiber embedding criterion using Theorem 10.4.6 and the fiber-orientation equivalence placed at Definition 10.3.1. The packaged `is-emb-equiv` and `emb-equiv` are retained downstream. |

The auxiliary belongs at Definition 10.3.1, but complete Section 10.3 must
remain unchanged on `main`. The exercise index and invisible-math record
describe the proposal placement. No direct coherent-inverse proof or new
unproven assumption is substituted. Section 11.4 and Chapter 11 are deferred
on `main`, and no Chapter 11 section is marked complete. Proposal `63e5e49`
passes Sections 10.3 and 11.1--11.4 and aggregate Chapters 10--11, all 150
unit tests, and repository checks. The Section 11.4 prose comparison preserves
all four headings and six displays, with no unresolved references or raw TeX
commands. Main's 148 tests pass; its affected Agda checks remain deferred.

## Section 11.5 (2026-09-06)

All four numbered items and both proofs are preserved. The source is the
pinned `foundation/equality-coproduct-types` module.

| Item | Formalization |
| --- | --- |
| Theorem 11.5.1 | `extensionality-coproduct` and all four `compute-eq-coproduct-*` equivalences, placed at the theorem's delayed proof after Proposition 11.5.4, not at its opening announcement. |
| Definition 11.5.2 | Upstream's indexed `Eq-coproduct` and four case equivalences. This represents the book's case table up to equivalence, not by judgmental reduction; both mixed cases are proved equivalent to `empty`. |
| Lemma 11.5.3 | Reflexivity, the canonical map by path induction, and its inverse map. |
| Proposition 11.5.4 | The centers and contractions for both summands. The copied proof contracts the indexed code directly by path induction; the prose retains the book's equivalent calculation with sums and total path spaces. |

Only two dependencies were added earlier. Exercise 9.4 receives equivalence
composition from its existing section/retraction composition laws. Example
9.2.9 receives the general empty-type equivalence criterion underlying the
absorption laws and mixed coproduct cases. Neither earlier file was complete:
Exercise 9.4 has recorded remaining parts, and Example 9.2.9 had none of its
displayed equivalences formalized. An explicit gap keeps those laws visible
despite the new auxiliary; no earlier complete section was enlarged.

The final theorem block keeps `theorem-11.5.1` as its mathematical identity
and uses an exact `after_text` anchor in its later proof. A regression test
checks that all dependencies precede it and that the four case conclusions
occur there. Trailing newlines are normalized after block insertion so an
anchor at the document end does not add a blank line. The prose comparison
has all seven headings and eight displays without unresolved references or
raw TeX commands. Section 11.5 remains deferred on `main` through the Chapter
10 exercises. Published proposal `3bbc564` passes the Section 11.5 candidate
and aggregate Chapters 9--11. Its 151-test suite and repository checks pass;
Section 9.2 and Exercise 9.4 also pass candidate checks on `main`.

Splitting the upstream modules requires explicit `x` and `y` arguments in
the four final composites and an explicit opposite summand in each of the
same-summand cases. The exact corrected draft passed the proposal scratchpad
check, was compared against the unchanged target block on `main`, and was
promoted with an atomic backup. No manual review evidence was refreshed.

## Section 11.6 (2026-09-06)

All three numbered items and the theorem's proof are preserved from
`book/fundamental.tex`, lines 427--515. Definition 11.6.1 specializes the
identity-system predicate to `λ y → D a y c`, with distinguished point `b`
and witness `d`. This is the same alias construction as the pinned homotopy
induction predicate, not a new induction proof.

Theorem 11.6.2 is not represented solely by the upstream forward structure
identity principle. The following explicitly typed specializations are curated
in addition to that construction and its packaged extensionality map:

| Conditions | Declarations and mathematical content |
| --- | --- |
| (i) ↔ (ii) | `dependent-equiv-from-contr` / `dependent-contr-from-equiv` instantiate both fundamental-theorem implications at `B a` and `λ y → D a y c`. The canonical family exists by path induction from `d`, so the universal assertion in (i) implies the hypothesis of the converse. |
| (ii) ↔ (iii) | `dependent-identity-system-from-contr` / `dependent-contr-from-identity-system` instantiate both identity-system implications of Theorem 11.2.2. |
| (iv) ↔ (v) | `structure-equiv-from-contr` / `structure-contr-from-equiv` instantiate the same fundamental theorem at `Σ A B` and its stated structure relation; `(c,d)` supplies the canonical family. |
| (v) ↔ (vi) | `structure-identity-system-from-contr` / `structure-contr-from-identity-system` instantiate the identity-system implications at `(a,b)` and `(c,d)`. |
| (ii) ↔ (v) | `interchange-Σ-Σ`, followed by Exercise 10.6's `left-unit-law-Σ-is-contr`, gives `equiv-total-Eq-structure`. The base identity-system hypothesis is used explicitly by `equiv-total-dependent-identity-system`. `is-torsorial-Eq-structure` and its prime converse transfer contractibility in the two directions. |

These are implication functions, not a claim that the six proof types have
been proved equivalent as types. The generic proofs are reused from their
pinned-source formalizations in Theorem 11.2.2 and Exercise 10.3. The only
earlier exercise added on `main` is Exercise 10.6, whose full inclusion-map
equivalence is needed by the book's displayed total-space calculation.
No generic dependent-sum contraction theorem is added to complete Section
10.1 solely to satisfy the upstream forward construction.

Example 11.6.3 is a new empty training site on `main`. The retained exact
proof route from `foundation/equality-fibers-of-maps` uses dependent-pair
identities, a fiberwise equivalence, and a commuting triangle to establish
the book's first displayed equivalence. Its inversion equivalence requires
`inv-inv` in complete Section 5.2, so its solution belongs on the shared
proposal. Required placements and source ranges are in the exercise index
and invisible-math record. The source proof differs from the book's direct
structure-identity-principle argument; the book's proof prose remains intact.

Two source discrepancies are made explicit rather than silently repaired:
the later formulas write `\ct{p}{q}^{-1}` where the first formula correctly
has `\ct{p}{q^{-1}}`; and the center of `Σ(y:A) x=y` is printed with
`refl_{f(x)}` rather than `refl_x`. The Agda statement uses the correctly
typed `p ∙ inv q`. The renderer's existing unannotated `refl` convention
does not expose that subscript discrepancy in the generated prose.

The `multline` display wrapper is now normalized by the converter, with a
regression test preserving each line. Full Chapters 3--22 regeneration changes
only this section and the new Exercise 10.6. The prose comparison preserves
all five headings and fourteen displays, without unresolved references or
raw TeX commands. Published proposal `6bd180b` passes candidate Sections 5.2
and 11.6, Exercises 9.1 and 10.6, and aggregate Chapters 5--11, with all 154
unit tests and repository checks passing. Main's 151 tests pass, but its Agda
checks remain deferred through the existing Chapter 10 exercises and this new
example. No Section 11.6 completion or optional review decision is recorded.

## Section 12.1 (2026-09-06)

All four numbered items, both proofs, and the transition prose in
`book/hierarchy.tex` are preserved. The generated prose has seven heading
occurrences (six distinct headings) and nine displays. The comparison is
100%, with no unresolved references or raw TeX commands; the duplicate
“Proof” heading is checked by inspecting both proof bodies, not by the
comparison's set-valued heading count alone.

| Item | Formalization |
| --- | --- |
| Definition 12.1.1 | `is-prop`, `Prop`, and their projections from `foundation-core/propositions`. The predicate is exactly contractibility of every identity type. |
| Example 12.1.2 | The generic `is-prop-is-contr` comes from the explicitly cited Exercise 10.1; its type expands the proposition predicate. The unit and empty proposition witnesses and packaged propositions are copied verbatim. |
| Proposition 12.1.3, (i)--(iii) | `all-elements-equal`, `is-proof-irrelevant`, and the implication functions from the pinned proposition module. In particular, `eq-is-prop'` gives (i) → (ii), and `is-proof-irrelevant-all-elements-equal` gives (ii) → (iii). |
| Proposition 12.1.3, (iii) → (iv) → (i) | The exact book proof route is in `foundation/subterminal-types`: assume a point with `is-emb-is-emb`, apply equivalence of contractible types and Theorem 11.4.2, then transfer contractibility along `ap` of the unit map for the converse. The copied `is-subterminal` predicate names condition (iv). |
| Proposition 12.1.4 | `is-equiv-has-converse-is-prop`, the two proposition-homotopies, and the packaged `equiv-iff*` maps from `foundation-core/logical-equivalences`; `iff-equiv` gives the reverse logical implication using the local inverse map. For a fixed map, its converse under `is-equiv` is already `map-section-is-equiv` from Section 9.2. |

The terminal map is expanded to `(λ (_ : A) → star)`, by the pinned
definitions of `terminal-map` and `const`. No general constant-map API is
added to the earlier complete function or unit sections. The point-assumption
lemma belongs in Proposition 12.1.3 because that proof explicitly states it.
Only Exercise 10.1 is added early: it was empty and is required here, and its
contractible-identity proof has no Chapter 12 dependency. Exercise 10.3's
already curated equivalence of contractible types suffices for the proof;
its remaining terminal-map characterization is still lower-priority work.

This section introduces no new training exercise. Its subterminal proof
depends on the existing Theorem 11.4.2 exercise, and transitively on the two
Chapter 10 exercises. Main's Exercise 10.1 candidate passes; Section 12.1 is
deferred, not passed. Published proposal `0c3d8b1` passes Section 12.1,
Exercise 10.1, and aggregate Chapters 10--12, with all 155 tests and repository
checks passing. Main's 152 tests and repository checks also pass, but no
completion or optional review state is inferred from its deferred Agda check.
All generated imports are repository-local; no later truncation theory or
function-extensionality assumption is imported ahead of its narrative home.

## Section 12.2 (2026-09-06)

All four numbered items, three proof bodies, and the introductory and
transition prose in `book/hierarchy.tex`, lines 97--191, are preserved.
The generated section has eight heading occurrences (six distinct headings)
and eleven displays. The prose comparison is 100%, with no unresolved
references or raw TeX commands; the three proof bodies were also inspected
individually, since the comparison counts distinct headings only.

| Item | Formalization |
| --- | --- |
| Definition 12.2.1 | `is-subtype`, `is-property`, the proposition-valued family `subtype`, its total space, membership predicate, inclusion, and action on identities. |
| Lemma 12.2.2 | Both `is-prop-equiv` and `is-prop-equiv'`, together with their map-level versions. The pinned `foundation-core/propositions` proof transfers inhabited contractibility. This proves the book's assertion by a different route from its direct `ap` argument; that full book proof is retained. |
| Theorem 12.2.3 | `is-prop-map` states the fiber condition. The retained `foundation-core/propositional-maps` proof gives both `is-emb-is-prop-map` and `is-prop-map-is-emb` using the fundamental theorem, the fiber-orientation equivalence, and inhabited contractibility. This proof block is a new empty training site on `main`. |
| Corollary 12.2.4 | Proposition-valued inclusion fibers, the subtype-inclusion embedding, its bundled embedding and identity equivalence, and both unbundled implications `is-subtype-is-emb-pr1` / `is-emb-pr1-is-subtype`. Exercise 10.7(a) supplies the projection-fiber equivalence at its exact book home. |

The final forward implication is an explicitly typed application of the
copied bundled-inclusion proof to `(λ x → (B x , H x))`; inclusion reduces
to `pr1`. No new proof is invented. The identity equivalence at the
corollary also supplies the introductory claim that equality in a subtype
is equivalent to equality of the underlying terms. The unused upstream
`injection-subtype` packaging is omitted; no injection API is imported.

Main's complete Section 10.3 is unchanged. The theorem directly requires
its absent `equiv-fiber`, so the new training site is recorded even though
proposal `63e5e49` already supplies that auxiliary for Theorem 11.4.2.
The shared-proposal solution must reuse the existing placement and restore
only this retained theorem block. Its fundamental-theorem applications also
depend on the two existing Chapter 10 exercises. Published proposal `7b6b28c`
implements exactly that solution and passes Section 12.2, Exercise 10.7, and
aggregate Chapters 10--12. All 156 proposal tests and repository checks pass.
Section 12.2 remains deferred on `main`, not complete or passed.

Exercise 10.7(a) passes its ordinary candidate check on `main`. Parts (b)
and (c) remain explicit Agda gaps. All problem text is retained, but the
existing converter renders its custom `subexenum` as a visible div without
the outer alphabetical part labels; this pre-existing exercise presentation
issue is not a claim of complete exercise prose fidelity. Section 12.2 itself
has no such custom list. All 153 main unit tests, repository checks, and
whitespace checks pass. No optional review evidence was refreshed.

## Section 12.3 (2026-09-06)

All five numbered items and the three full proof bodies in
`book/hierarchy.tex`, lines 191--287, are preserved. The generated section
has nine heading occurrences (seven distinct headings) and ten displays.
The prose comparison is 100%, with no unresolved references or raw TeX
commands. All three proof bodies were compared individually, not inferred
from the comparison's set-valued heading count.

| Item | Formalization |
| --- | --- |
| Definition 12.3.1 | `is-set` is the exact identity-propositionality predicate, with only `UU` renamed to `Type`. The general universe of truncated types belongs in Definition 12.4.1. |
| Example 12.3.2 | The verbatim induction proving `is-prop-Eq-ℕ`, followed by the explicitly typed specialization of `is-prop-is-equiv` to Theorem 11.3.1's equality-code equivalence. This follows the book's proof without using the later relation criterion. |
| Proposition 12.3.3 | The type-specific `instance-axiom-K` and both implication functions. The source's converse uses path induction with the explicit K hypothesis instead of the book's concatenation-cancellation presentation. No global K witness, postulate, or compiler-option change is introduced. |
| Theorem 12.3.4 | The pinned based and binary relation proofs, including total-space contraction and `is-set-prop-in-id`. The separate `is-equiv-id-in-prop` specializes the existing fundamental theorem to that contraction for an arbitrary family `(f : (x y : A) → x ＝ y → R x y)`. Equivalence of the chosen reverse map alone would not cover the statement. |
| Theorem 12.3.5 | The unit/empty relation chosen by the equality decision, its propositionality and reflexivity, its map back to identity, and the application of Theorem 12.3.4. All three hypotheses of the relation criterion are supplied explicitly, matching the book's Hedberg proof. |

The based proof at Theorem 12.3.4 is a new empty training site on `main`.
Its general retract fundamental theorem belongs at Theorem 11.2.2, after
the existing variants; its total-map homotopy, identity, and composition
laws belong after `tot` at Definition 11.1.1. The existing earlier
mathematical accounts pass on the proposal but remain deferred on main
through their recorded dependencies. Keep those earlier main files unchanged.
The exercise index and invisible-math record specify all source ranges,
local adaptations, dependency order, and later users. Published proposal
`b96fdf3` implements these placements, and passes candidate Sections
11.1--11.6 and 12.1--12.3 and aggregate Chapters 10--12. All 158 proposal
unit tests, repository checks, and whitespace checks pass. The generated
prose of the two changed earlier sections is unchanged; their comparison
checks remain 100%. Section 12.3 is deferred on `main`, never recorded
complete or passed. All 154 main unit tests, repository checks, and
whitespace checks pass. No exercise Agda or optional review evidence is changed.

## Section 12.4 (2026-09-07)

The seven numbered items and four proof bodies in `book/hierarchy.tex`,
lines 288--421, retain their complete prose. The introductory indexing
type and natural-number inclusion are curated before Definition 12.4.1.
The introduction's announced future identification with integers at least
-2 is not presented by the book as a theorem proved here.

| Item | Formalization and limits |
| --- | --- |
| Introduction | The inductive `𝕋`, common aliases, and pinned `truncation-level-ℕ`. Its two defining computations agree judgmentally with the book's inclusion after unfolding the shifted maps. |
| Definition 12.4.1 | Recursive `is-trunc`, the proper-successor predicate as a specialization of complements, the universe `Truncated-Type` and its projections, and `is-trunc-map` with its map bundle. |
| Remark 12.4.2 | The pinned lift and its equivalence, followed by both lifted truncation implications after Proposition 12.4.5. **Representation gap:** Agda's disjoint universes do not literally express the book's same type in two overlapping universes. Neither polymorphism nor the lifted analogue proves those judgmental base equalities. The original claim stays in the prose and the gap inventory. |
| Proposition 12.4.3 | The pinned base contraction and recursive successor proof. |
| Corollary 12.4.4 | Identity truncatedness as the preceding successor theorem. |
| Proposition 12.4.5 | Both map-level and bundled equivalence transfers. Upstream uses a broader retract induction, included as a labeled prerequisite; the book's equivalence-on-identities induction is retained, not claimed to be the copied proof. |
| Corollary 12.4.6 | Transfer along the equivalence on identities supplied by the embedding hypothesis. |
| Theorem 12.4.7 | Both pinned implications using the general and specialized fiber identity equivalences. Their single block is a new empty training site on main; the retained converse requires an absent specialization and transport equivalence at earlier mathematical homes. |

Exercise 12.8(a)'s identity-retract proof is needed by the section, so it
is added now and imports no Chapter 12 section. The proof of part (b)
appears at Proposition 12.4.5 to avoid a section/exercise import cycle;
there is no outstanding mathematical part-(b) proof to invent. The
exercise's pre-existing custom-list presentation drops its alphabetical
labels, as in Exercise 10.7, and remains an explicit presentation issue.
Corollary 12.4.4 also retains the existing tight inline QED spacing.
No complete-file or optional-review status is inferred from these blocks.

Main passes all 156 unit tests, repository checks, and whitespace checks;
Exercise 12.8(a) passes its ordinary Agda candidate check. Section 12.4
and Chapter 12 are deferred, never passed. Published shared-proposal
solution `31222b8` passes candidate Sections 11.6 and 12.4, Exercises
9.1 and 12.8, and aggregate Chapters 9--12; all 161 proposal unit tests
and repository checks pass. It supplies the transport equivalence at
Exercise 9.1 and the fiber specialization at Example 11.6.3, restoring
both later theorem implications without changing their code. The literal
overlapping-universe gap remains explicit on both branches.

The raw prose comparison is 98.26%, with 9/13 distinct
headings matching: its four unmatched headings are precisely the new,
explicit Agda headings. After removing only those headings and curated
Agda, a regression test confirms equality with the rendered book text,
including all item markers and thirteen displays, modulo whitespace.
The book itself has twelve heading occurrences, nine distinct. There are
no unresolved references or raw TeX commands. No review data is changed.
Section 11.6's unchanged prose still compares at 100%.

## Section 13.1 (2026-09-07)

All seven numbered items and three full proof bodies in `book/funext.tex`,
lines 28--152, are preserved. Twenty provenance-backed blocks account for
the mathematics; the inference-rule remark needs no second declaration.

| Item | Formalization |
| --- | --- |
| Proposition 13.1.1 | `htpy-eq` with its reflexivity computation, instance and based extensionality predicates, evaluation at the reflexivity homotopy, and the homotopy-induction predicate. Four explicitly typed applications of the existing fundamental-theorem and identity-system proofs give (i) iff (ii) iff (iii). These are implications, not an equivalence between the types of proofs. |
| Theorem 13.1.2 | Fixed-universe extensionality and weak-extensionality predicates and both pinned implication proofs. The weak-to-strong proof retains the two maps of the section-retraction pair and its identity homotopy. Both implications use their hypotheses, before any global axiom is in scope. The two-level version specializes to the book's single universe. |
| Axiom 13.1.3 | The pinned coherent-inverse presentation: `eq-htpy`, its section and retraction homotopies, and their coherence are explicitly postulated. `funext` and the two equivalence bundles are consequences of those assumptions, not a proof of function extensionality. Proposition 9.2.7 and Lemma 10.4.5 relate this chosen coherent-inverse presentation to the book's equivalence formulation. |
| Remark 13.1.4 | The full contextual inference rule is retained as a faithful proof-tree draft. Its mathematical content is the preceding context-polymorphic assumption, so no separate Agda declaration or extra axiom is added. |
| Theorem 13.1.5 | The contractible-dependent-product base case, induction on truncation level using `funext` and Section 12.4's equivalence invariance, and the needed proposition-valued specialization. |
| Corollary 13.1.6 | Both the general truncation result and the proposition specialization for constant families. |
| Remark 13.1.7 | `is-prop-neg`, by functions into the empty proposition. This proof uses function extensionality; the prose observation about needing the axiom is not presented as a formal independence theorem. |

The pinned `homotopy-induction` implication from based extensionality uses
the global `is-torsorial-htpy`, ignoring its explicit hypothesis. Importing
that proof would assume the conclusion before Axiom 13.1.3. Instead, the
four typed specializations use the already curated hypothesis-parametric
Theorem 11.2.2. No new general proof or earlier auxiliary is invented.
The `ev a` in `htpy-eq` is definitionally expanded to `(λ h → h a)` using
the pinned evaluation definition; complete Section 2.2 is not enlarged.
The book's incomplete binder `f,g:Π(x:A)` in the prose of Theorem 13.1.5
is retained as written; the Agda statement includes the codomain `B x`.

The raw comparison is 99.57%, with 9/10 distinct headings: the only added
heading labels the assumed coherent-inverse presentation. Removing that
heading and curated Agda gives exactly the rendered book text, modulo
whitespace, as a regression test checks. The book has eleven heading
occurrences and thirteen text fences, including its inference rule.
The labelled retraction arrows now render as `⟶[i]` and `⟶[r]`, and
the rule's type judgment renders `type`, using `book/hott.tex` line 212.
No unresolved references or raw TeX commands remain in this section.

Those converter rules regenerated thirteen affected sections: 1.1--1.4,
2.1--2.2, 3.1--3.2, 5.1, 6.1--6.2, 13.1, and 14.2. Regeneration also
refreshes the existing item-end boundaries, notably in Section 2.2;
all pre-existing Agda code and its order remain byte-identical. All
thirteen candidate checks and aggregate Chapters 1--6 and 13--14 passed
after the prose repair, before new Section 13.1 Agda was inserted.
That earlier empty-section check is not evidence for the new mathematics.

Main passes all 160 unit tests, repository checks (534 verified blocks),
and whitespace checks. The new Section 13.1 and Chapter 13 are deferred on
main through existing training dependencies. Published proposal merge
`dc97e2f5941b950b2cfd3283794adee1278891b2` passes actual candidate checks
for Sections 2.2 and 13.1, aggregate Chapters 1--6 and 13--14, all 165
unit tests, repository checks (546 verified blocks), and whitespace checks.
The Section 2.2 merge was regenerated from the combined manifest and
preserves every proposal Agda block and its order byte-for-byte. Both
branches' regression tests were retained. No new training site, exercise
Agda, complete-file record, or review decision is added.

## Section 13.2 (2026-09-07)

The four numbered items, three complete proofs, and intervening
products-of-fibers equivalence in `book/funext.tex`, lines 153--281, are
preserved. Seven section blocks and the one needed Exercise 9.5(b) block
carry full pinned provenance.

| Item | Formalization |
| --- | --- |
| Theorem 13.2.1 | Both choice types, both maps, both inverse homotopies, and both equivalence bundles. The Agda record-Σ representation has judgmental η, so the pinned second homotopy is `refl`; this does not formalize the book's explicit assertion that its inductive Σ lacks this rule. The full book proof using function extensionality is retained. A visible heading and gap record mark the representation difference; the existing Section 4.6 record is unchanged. |
| Corollary 13.2.2 | The ordinary-function map, its equivalence proof, and equivalence bundle, specialized from choice. |
| Intervening display | `equiv-Π-fiber-section` is a typed specialization of choice to the family `f a ＝ b`. Its block follows that display, outside Corollary 13.2.2 and before Corollary 13.2.3, with an exact `after_text` anchor checked by regression. |
| Corollary 13.2.3 | The pinned three-equivalence calculation using choice on the base, the Exercise 9.5(b) right swap, and the existing Exercise 10.6 contractible-base law. The total reverse-homotopy space is contracted using inverse choice, products of contractible types, and `is-contr-Id'`. The alternative citation to Exercise 13.1 remains prose; that exercise is not needed or filled. |
| Theorem 13.2.4 | The pinned total-space contractibility proof, then a typed application of the existing identity-system/contractibility conversions at `f` and its pointwise reflexivity data. The declaration explicitly takes identity systems as hypotheses and returns the dependent-product identity system; it is not merely the intermediate contraction. |

Exercise 9.5 was previously uncurated, not an earlier complete file.
Only its exact part (b) is needed and added, with a labeled solution heading.
Part (a) and the existing loss of alphabetical problem labels in custom-list
rendering remain explicit gaps. No new training site or earlier complete
section enlargement is needed. Main still defers Section 13.2 through the
existing training dependencies.

Removing the two visible Agda headings and all code reproduces the rendered
book prose exactly modulo whitespace. Raw comparison is 99.21%, with 6/8
distinct headings, all 21 text fences, no unresolved references, and no raw
TeX commands. Regression tests check the complete prose, declaration scope,
the intervening display, full inverse data, and the remaining exercise gap.
Main passes all 162 unit tests, repository checks (542 verified blocks),
Exercise 9.5's candidate and aggregate Chapter 9, and whitespace checks.
Section 13.2 and aggregate Chapter 13 are deferred, not passed. Published
proposal `161b3c1b0b270cbcd06a4a60513271df4690f969` passes actual Agda
for Section 13.2, Exercise 9.5, and aggregate Chapters 9 and 13, all 167
unit tests, repository checks (554 verified blocks), and whitespace checks.
Its only correction adds a direct import for the existing equivalence
composition in Exercise 9.4; the exact scratchpad passed and all proof
bodies remain unchanged. That focused correction is also on main, without
the proposal's training solutions. No review state or complete-file record is changed.

## Section 13.3 (2026-09-07)

The three numbered items, both complete proofs, and both introductory
ordinary-family universal properties in `book/funext.tex`, lines 282--377,
are accounted for by five provenance-backed blocks.

| Item | Formalization |
| --- | --- |
| Theorem 13.3.1 | The pinned `is-equiv-ev-pair`, with `ind-Σ` as both inverse maps, the reflexivity computation, and the explicit `eq-htpy (ind-Σ ...)` inverse homotopy, followed by its forward equivalence bundle. Reuse `ev-pair` from Remark 4.6.3. The source's separate assertion that the inverse is an equivalence is not required by this theorem and is omitted; all inverse data needed for the stated equivalence is retained. |
| Introductory ordinary Σ property | Explicit typed specializations of that proof and bundle to a constant codomain family. They follow the general proof within its item, with a visible heading explaining the connection to the introduction. |
| Corollary 13.3.2 | The equivalence proof and bundle for the forward currying map `(A × B → X) → (A → B → X)`, specializing both families to constants. It is not merely the oppositely oriented uncurrying equivalence. |
| Theorem 13.3.3 | Evaluation at reflexivity, its computation homotopy, the two nested function-extensionality applications around path induction, and the equivalence and bundle. No unrelated later univalence results from the source module are imported. |
| Introductory ordinary identity property | Explicit proof and bundle specializations to a family independent of the path argument, after the dependent proof and under a visible heading. |

The book's redundant extra function-extensionality wording in the first
proof and its free `p` in the displayed type of `f` in the second proof
remain as written; the Agda statements have the fully bound dependent
types. No source prose was silently corrected. Removing code and the two
explicit specialization headings recovers the rendered book text exactly,
modulo whitespace. Raw comparison is 98.72%, with 7/9 distinct headings,
all ten text fences, no unresolved references, and no raw TeX commands.
Regression tests check the complete prose, placement and declaration order,
both inverse maps, and the explicit induction/function-extensionality proofs.

No earlier complete file, exercise Agda, training site, review decision,
or complete-file record is changed. Section 13.3 is deferred on main through
the existing Section 13.1 imports. Published proposal merge
`6c408d4247f512bc7ce8cfbafbd4b11edce697b8` passes actual Agda for Section
13.3 and aggregate Chapter 13, all 168 unit tests, repository checks
(559 verified blocks), and whitespace checks. No new solution code or
correction was needed on that branch.
Main passes all 163 unit tests, repository checks (547 verified blocks),
and whitespace checks. Its Section 13.3 and Chapter 13 results remain
deferred, not passed.

## Section 13.4 (2026-09-07)

Theorem 13.4.1, its three conditions, and its complete proof in
`book/funext.tex`, lines 378--461, are accounted for by eleven
provenance-backed blocks. All code follows the theorem's full prose proof,
in dependency order, without additional headings.

| Assertion | Formalization |
| --- | --- |
| Conditions (ii) and (iii) | The dependent and ordinary precomposition maps and universe-polymorphic predicates, preserving every family and every codomain. Their first book occurrence is this theorem; no earlier function-type account is enlarged. |
| (i) implies (ii) | Convert the given equivalence to a coherent inverse using the existing Lemma 10.4.5. Copy the transport inverse and both homotopies from the pinned dependent universal property. The section homotopy explicitly uses coherence, transport substitution, and dependent action on paths; the retraction uses dependent action on paths. |
| (ii) implies (iii) | The pinned constant-family specialization, consuming the dependent universal property hypothesis. |
| (iii) implies (i) | Specialize the pinned structured-type proof to ordinary types, retaining the constructed inverse and both homotopies. The fiber of precomposition into A at id supplies the inverse and its retraction law. The fiber of precomposition into B at f supplies the section law, comparing `(f ∘ h, p)` with `(id, refl)`. |
| Consequences | Both dependent and ordinary equivalence bundles, the composite (i) implies (iii), and the composite (ii) implies (i). Together these explicitly connect all three conditions. |

The missing name `substitution-law-tr` is not missing mathematics: its pinned
definition in `foundation-core/transport-along-identifications`, lines
87--91, is precisely `tr-ap f (λ _ → id) p x'`. Section 9.3 already contains
that general `tr-ap`. The new proof expands only this wrapper, with the
secondary source range and hash recorded in its manifest note. Section 5.4
is unchanged. The coherent-inverse wrapper uses the existing local route
through invertibility, not new path-split machinery. The converse removes
only the unnecessary structured-type parameters and names; its full proof
body remains. Its equality in the fiber has the opposite orientation to
the book's display and directly yields `f ∘ h ~ id`; the book prose is
preserved without a silent correction.

Removing Agda and block markers recovers the rendered book text exactly
modulo whitespace. Raw comparison is 100%, with all three headings and
thirteen text fences, no unresolved references, and no raw TeX commands.
The regression test checks full prose, placement, universe quantification,
all implications, both inverse homotopies, and the two contractible fibers.
No earlier complete file, exercise Agda, training site, review state, or
complete-file record is changed.

Main passes all 164 unit tests, repository checks (558 verified blocks),
and whitespace checks. Section 13.4 and aggregate Chapter 13 correctly
defer through existing training dependencies. Published proposal merge
`b42184ff92633edf5d9dd24eebc5a0b79babd86b` passes actual Agda for the
Section 13.4 candidate and aggregate Chapter 13, all 169 unit tests,
repository checks (570 verified blocks), and whitespace checks. No code
correction or new solution was needed. Main's deferred results are not
passes, and all seven training holes remain unchanged.

## Section 13.5 (2026-09-07)

Twelve section blocks and one needed exercise block account for the three
numbered items, intervening construction, and full delayed proof in
`book/funext.tex`, lines 462--636. One section block is a new empty training
site on main, with its intended typed specialization retained in the manifest.

| Item or assertion | Formalization |
| --- | --- |
| Intervening bounded family | The pinned `□-≤-ℕ`, at the displayed definition of P-tilde after the theorem statement and before the lemmas. |
| Lemma 13.5.2 | The bounded base value and its reflexivity computation, with the required judgmental defining equation. |
| Lemma 13.5.3, case splitter | Reuse Exercise 7.3's existing map. Copy the proposition proof for inequalities at this first explicit assertion; specialize the disjoint-coproduct proposition theorem at its required Exercise 12.4(c) home. Use the existing proposition-equivalence constructor with explicit forward and reverse maps, and expose `f(p)=x` for every case x. |
| Lemma 13.5.3, successor and laws | The full pinned case evaluator, successor construction, both case-helper proofs and both computation laws. Use existing inequality contradiction and transport, with no new earlier helper. |
| Lemma 13.5.3, identity-type equivalence | The displayed equivalence is the typed inverse-concatenation equivalence along the action of the case evaluator on `f(p)=x`. It needs the existing proposal-only Exercise 9.1 auxiliary, so its later block is empty on main and recorded as a training exercise. |
| Theorem 13.5.1, delayed proof | Bounded induction at its displayed computation, diagonal evaluation at its definition, then the complete strong induction function, base and successor computation proofs, inductive helpers, and function-and-laws bundle after the full delayed proof. Both function-extensionality applications remain explicit. |

The source's implicit-index case splitter is replaced by the already
available explicit-index `decide-leq-succ-ℕ`. Its separate reflexive-case
computation is replaced by the corresponding instance of the book's
already stated proposition equality `f(p)=x`. The source's successor
contradiction is the existing order contradiction at reflexivity. These
typed specializations and their sources are recorded in the manifest and
invisible-math index; no new general Agda proof is invented.

The prose renderer now preserves `\textasteriskcentered` before Pandoc
can drop it, so the displayed `(*)` tag and prose reference agree.
Matched `cases` environments render with explicit `cases { ... }`
boundaries and every value and condition retained. This recurring repair
also regenerates Section 8.2's Collatz display, without changing its Agda
or reserved manual-review data. Regression tests cover both forms of
case display, malformed-input preservation, symbol boundaries, and the
complete Section 13.5 prose and code placement. Removing code recovers
the rendered source exactly modulo whitespace: raw comparison is 100%,
all five distinct headings and 28 text fences, with no raw TeX commands
or unresolved references.

Main passes all 169 unit tests, repository checks (571 verified blocks),
and whitespace checks. Section 8.2 and aggregate Chapter 8 pass Agda.
Section 13.5, Exercise 12.4, and aggregate Chapters 12--13 correctly
defer. Published proposal solution
`e8105dd4b8247547602a1d1b5a4e68542faa4acd` restores only the retained
identity-type equivalence and passes actual Agda for Sections 8.2 and
13.5, Exercise 12.4, and aggregate Chapters 8 and 12--13. All 174 unit
tests, repository checks (583 verified blocks), and whitespace checks
pass there. No proof correction or earlier auxiliary addition was needed.
Main retains all eight training holes; no review or complete-file record
is changed.

## Section 14.1: universal property of propositional truncations

The active input order, recomputed from `book/hott-intro.tex`, assigns
`book/propositional-truncation.tex` to Chapter 14 and `book/univalence.tex`
to Chapter 17. The preceding handoff confused those numbers. Its univalence
research is retained for Section 17.1; the generated registry and source
order are unchanged. The Chapter 14 introduction was inspected in full.

All five numbered items and the complete proof in Section 14.1 are
accounted for by thirteen provenance-backed blocks:

| Item | Curated mathematical content |
| --- | --- |
| Definition 14.1.1 | Precomposition between maps into propositions and the universe-polymorphic equivalence predicate on an arbitrary map. No truncation constructor or existence assumption. |
| Remark 14.1.2 | The exact displayed equality-based fiber of extensions, both contractibility/equivalence implications, the extension map, and its equality computation from the two center projections. |
| Remark 14.1.3 | The extension predicate and both implications. The preliminary converse-map criterion and proposition-valued function types reuse Proposition 12.1.4 and Corollary 13.1.6; no duplicate earlier mathematics is added. |
| Proposition 14.1.4 | The complete nested-Sigma proof that equivalences between propositions form a proposition, the equivalence constructed from both extension maps, and both remaining transfer implications. Thus all three assertions and every two-imply-third case, including uniqueness, are represented. |
| Remark 14.1.5 | Double negations are propositions; precomposition by double-negation introduction is an equivalence into doubly negated types, with the existing Exercise 4.3 Kleisli extension as inverse data. The limitation to doubly negated targets and the metatheoretic warning about existence remain prose, not unproved general Agda claims. |

The source's unique-extension formulation uses pointwise homotopies. The
book instead displays an equality of functions. The curation keeps that
exact equality-based Sigma and specializes the already local
contractible-map equivalence criterion directly. The center projections
are unchanged. This deliberate formulation adaptation is recorded in
the manifest and invisible-mathematics record; it requires neither a new
inverse proof nor an unmentioned function-extensionality transfer.

Only the needed proposition-level forward implication of Exercise 12.6(a)
and its constant-family specialization are added early. They use the
pinned subtype-embedding proof, applied to the existing Corollaries
12.2.4 and 12.4.6. Its general-truncation case, converse, part (b), and
outer alphabetical presentation labels remain explicit exercise gaps.
No earlier complete section, existing exercise proof, training site,
review evidence, or completion record is changed.

Main passes 171 unit tests, repository checks (586 verified blocks), and
whitespace checks. Candidate Section 14.1, Exercise 12.6, and aggregate
Chapters 12--14 are deferred, not passed. Removing Agda recovers the
rendered source exactly modulo whitespace: 100% prose comparison,
7/7 headings, 10/10 text fences, no unresolved references or raw TeX.
The three existing diagram drafts and their review markers are unchanged.
Published proposal merge `7ba38d00a91229d5311cba0c2a400b3160ebf93f`
passes actual Agda for Section 14.1, Exercise 12.6, and aggregate Chapters
12--14, all 176 unit tests, repository checks (598 verified blocks), and
whitespace checks. No proof correction or new training solution was
needed. The merge's gap-list insertion conflict was resolved by retaining
both the proposal's existing Exercise 9.1 remainder and the new Exercise
12.6 remainder; neither record was discarded.

## Section 14.2: propositional truncations as higher-inductive types

Eighteen provenance-backed blocks account for the introduction and all
five numbered items in `book/propositional-truncation.tex`, lines 103--255.

| Item or assertion | Curated mathematical content |
| --- | --- |
| Formation and universe rules | The proposition-level specialization of pinned truncation formation and its notation alias, explicitly labeled as assumed. All three book proof trees are preserved. Agda's Russell-style universes do not separately represent the checked Tarski code and decoding judgment; that gap is recorded, not claimed proved. |
| Point and path constructors | Two explicitly labeled assumptions. The point specializes pinned truncations; the path uses the pinned analogous HIT postulate pattern and exact propositional-truncation path signature. No general truncation axiom or unrelated circle import is introduced. |
| Lemma 14.2.1 | Derive the proposition proof from the path constructor using Proposition 12.1.3; bundle the type and its proof. |
| Definition 14.2.2 | The complete pinned path-clause and induction predicates, including the Sigma of dependent function and point computation homotopy. Explicitly assume that HIT induction witness, then expose both projections as the eliminator and computation rule. No judgmental rewrite or universal-property axiom is substituted. |
| Remark 14.2.3 | Both implications of the path-clause/proposition criterion, the transport embedding and reverse identity equivalence, and the proposition-valued eliminator with its computation. The pinned forward criterion uses an inhabited contraction rather than the book's embedding proof; the book's displayed equivalence is retained separately as the new training site. |
| Theorem 14.2.4 | Constant-family recursion and its computation, then derive the universal property from the proposition-valued eliminator using Section 14.1's extension criterion. Retain the equality-based unique-extension witness and its map projection. |
| Proposition 14.2.5 | Transfer equality-based unique extensions to homotopy-based extensions by the explicitly recorded total equivalence of function extensionality. Project the unique map and its computation, prove uniqueness by contraction and action on paths, and retain the full identity and composition laws. |

All four assumptions have visible “Assumed” headings and precede the
derived universal-property theorem. Their source ranges, hashes, analogous
HIT patterns, and necessary local adaptations are recorded in the manifest
and invisible-mathematics index. No earlier complete file is enlarged and
no exercise Agda is added. In particular, the absent general transport
equivalence belongs at Exercise 9.1; the proposal already supplies it there.
The later Remark 14.2.3 block stays empty on main as the ninth training site.

The renderer's former bounded-depth regex silently lost a nested universe
conclusion. Balanced argument scanning now preserves arbitrary nesting,
escaped braces, and external sentence punctuation, and rejects malformed
rule arguments rather than emitting an empty conclusion. The truncation
code macro is normalized explicitly. Regeneration also removes stray math
delimiters from earlier proof trees, without changing any earlier Agda.
The two visible unsupported-minipage diagnostics remain; their mathematical
contents are preserved. No source prose typo is silently corrected.

Removing Agda and the four assumption headings recovers the rendered source
exactly modulo whitespace. Raw comparison is 99.07%, with 10/14 distinct
headings and all 18 text fences, no unresolved references or raw TeX.
Regression tests check all items, assumptions and declaration placement,
full prose, complete induction/computation data, both criterion directions,
the explicit function-extensionality transfer, and both functorial laws.

Main passes all 176 unit tests, repository checks (604 verified blocks),
and whitespace checks. Changed Sections 1.1--1.4, 2.1--2.2, and 3.1--3.2
and aggregate Chapters 1--3 pass Agda; their Agda fences are unchanged.
Section 14.2 and aggregate Chapter 14 correctly defer. Published proposal
solution `d9fe7afc68edc25d011dcddba86f3ed6de739934` restores the retained
transport block without proof corrections or earlier auxiliary additions.
It passes actual Agda for Section 14.2, all eight earlier changed
sections, and aggregate Chapters 1--3 and 14, all 181 unit tests,
repository checks (616 verified blocks), and whitespace checks. The
main-to-proposal merge preserved all existing Section 2.2 Agda and both
independently inserted gap records. Main keeps all nine training sites
empty; no completion or review record is changed.

## Section 14.3: logic in type theory

Seventeen section blocks and one needed exercise block account for the
four numbered items, both complete proofs, and all eight connective-table
interpretations in `book/propositional-truncation.tex`, lines 256--341.

| Item | Curated mathematical content |
| --- | --- |
| Definition 14.3.1 | The pinned truncation of an underlying coproduct, its proposition proof, and the actual proposition-valued disjunction and notation. |
| Proposition 14.3.2 | Both introduction maps at their defining display, evaluation, the arbitrary-target universal-property predicates, the coproduct-recursion converse and logical equivalence, and the full composite-equivalence proof with both arrow witnesses. |
| Definition 14.3.3 | The pinned truncation of an underlying dependent sum, its proposition proof, and the actual proposition-family existential quantification and notation. |
| Proposition 14.3.4 | Dependent introduction at its epsilon sentence, arbitrary-target predicates, evaluation, the Sigma-induction converse and logical equivalence, and the full composite-equivalence proof with both arrow witnesses. |
| Table | Unit and empty propositions reuse Example 12.1.2; disjunction and existence reuse the section's definitions. Implication, conjunction, bi-implication, and universal quantification receive their pinned proposition bundles after the complete table, using the existing closure proofs. |
| Required Exercise 13.8 | The entire dependent coproduct universal property, explicit induction inverse and both homotopies, forward equivalence bundle, and ordinary specialization, at its exact cited exercise home. |

The two composite proofs are typed applications of Exercise 9.4's existing
composition theorem. Their first arrow uses Theorem 14.2.4; their second
uses Exercise 13.8 or Theorem 13.3.1, respectively. No earlier complete
section is enlarged, no training solution is copied into main, and no
postulate or later axiom is introduced. The underlying-type helpers are
followed by the book's exact proposition specializations; they are not a
substitution of untruncated disjunction or Sigma for the logical operators.
The motivating nonclosure discussion and the exercise's free-b typo are
preserved as written; no new unproved Agda assertion replaces that prose.

The table's two columns now retain the source distinction between `⊥`
and `empty`, and between `⇔` and `↔`. The same notation repair regenerates
Exercise 14.8 without adding Agda. Section 7.1's existing correct table
is unchanged after regeneration. Both diagram drafts and the visible
unsupported-center diagnostic remain. The four table blocks share a
final-row anchor, with tested reverse insertion order; no code splits the
Markdown table or intrudes into the preceding proposition.

Removing Agda and the one table heading recovers the rendered section
exactly modulo whitespace. Raw comparison is 99.49%, with 6/7 distinct
headings and all eight text fences, no unresolved references or raw TeX.
Regression tests check every numbered item, both explicit composite
equivalence arguments, the introduction anchors, all table rows, table
block order, full prose, and the complete exercise inverse data.

Main passes all 180 unit tests, repository checks (622 verified blocks),
and whitespace checks. Section 7.1 and Chapter 7 pass Agda. Section
14.3, Exercise 13.8, and aggregate Chapters 13--14 correctly defer through
the existing training sites. Published proposal merge
`b792e7b63caf4041d01ec3cfca503a923a7716b3` passes actual Agda for Section
14.3, Exercise 13.8, Section 7.1, and aggregate Chapters 7 and 13--14,
all 185 unit tests, repository checks (634 verified blocks), and whitespace
checks. It needed no proof correction or new training solution. Main's
deferred checks are not passes. No review or complete-file record is changed.

## Section 14.4: mapping propositional truncations into sets

Twenty-two provenance-backed blocks account for the introduction and all
six numbered items in `book/propositional-truncation.tex`, lines 342--457.

| Item or assertion | Curated mathematical content |
| --- | --- |
| Introductory strategy | Specialize the pinned projection-after-proposition-elimination construction to an arbitrary family over X whose total space is a proposition. |
| Example 14.4.1 | The lower-bound proposition, the identity equivalence for minimal elements, the antisymmetry proof that their type is a proposition, extension of the existing well-ordering map, projection to the desired natural-number choice map, and the complete finite-type corollary via the pinned reduction to natural numbers. |
| Remark 14.4.2 | Hilbert's epsilon-operator predicate on a type. No global-choice assumption is introduced; the univalence-based negative assertion stays explicitly deferred to Corollary 17.5.3. |
| Definition 14.4.3 | The pointwise weak-constancy predicate and its map bundle. |
| Remark 14.4.4 | The book's constant-map predicate, constant implies weakly constant, both contractible/constant-identity implications, and both proposition/weakly-constant-identity implications. |
| Lemma 14.4.5 | The explicit action of g on the assumed truncation path constructor, then the full commuting-triangle result with its endpoint homotopies; B remains arbitrary. |
| Theorem 14.4.6 | The exact precomposition map using action on the path constructor, uniqueness by propositional identity induction before existence, the image-proposition proof with both nested eliminations and the three-path composite, the factorization and extension, its computation homotopy, the proposition of weak-constancy witnesses, both inverse homotopies, and the equivalence proof. |

The finite construction reuses the existing Chapter 7 maps and their section
law, and the natural-number construction reuses Definition 8.3.1 and Theorem
8.3.2. No earlier complete file or exercise Agda is enlarged. The book's
constant-map predicate is upstream `is-null-homotopic-map`, not upstream's
different coherently-constant predicate. The identity/contractibility maps
are typed specializations of the existing total-space map to inversion of
homotopies, reversing the two conventions for contraction paths.

The pinned Set bundle and Id-Prop wrappers are expanded into a type, its
set witness, and explicit identity propositions. The subtype-equality
wrapper is expanded using the inverse of Corollary 12.2.4's existing
identity equivalence. Argument-reordered truncation elimination and twofold
product closure are likewise expanded into existing operations. These are
wrapper changes, not absent earlier mathematics. Their exact secondary
sources and hashes are in the manifest. The image argument belongs at this
theorem and does not import Chapter 15. Section 14.1's equality-based
interface and Section 14.2's four labeled HIT assumptions are unchanged.

Removing Agda recovers the complete rendered source exactly modulo
whitespace. Comparison reports 100% prose similarity, all 8 headings and
15 text fences, no unresolved cross-references, and no raw TeX commands.
The three diagram IDs and the repaired Kraus citation remain intact.
Regression tests cover every item, all implications, the explicit finite
reduction, the path-constructor map, both inverse proofs, source provenance,
absence of copied earlier auxiliaries, every insertion boundary, and the
proof order, especially uniqueness before the image construction.

Main passes 187 unit tests, repository checks (644 verified blocks), and
whitespace checks. Section 14.4 and aggregate Chapter 14 defer through the
nine existing training sites, not pass. The exact 22-block draft passed
Agda against the shared proposal's solved prerequisites before curation.
Published proposal merge `4524b3ac744d3be90ee758b827a31c22ce4c6b7b` passes
actual Agda for the curated Section 14.4 and aggregate Chapter 14, all
192 unit tests, repository checks (656 verified blocks), and whitespace
checks. No proof correction or new solution was needed. The merge retains
the existing evaluation-placement test alongside the new section tests;
only their shared insertion location conflicted. No new training site or
completion/review decision is added, and main retains all nine empty sites.
