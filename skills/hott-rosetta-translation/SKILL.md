# HoTT Rosetta translation

## Start

Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/implementation-handoff.md`, and
`docs/conversion-contract.md`. Then read only the references needed:

- section work: `references/section-files.md` and `references/latex-to-markdown.md`
- chapter aggregation: `references/chapter-files.md`
- requested or required exercise work: `references/exercise-files.md`

Inspect the LaTeX, converter, curated data, and active generated output in
scope. Obtain the output path from `data/project-layout.json`; never use
`archive/legacy-rosetta/`.

## Work

Prioritize remaining section Agda across Chapters 3--22. Defer exercise Agda
unless a section depends on it.

For each section item, search pinned `external/agda-unimath` for exact code and
then close analogues. Copy the closest applicable source; never invent code.
Preserve upstream names and structure when possible, make only necessary local
adaptations, and use repository-local imports.

Record commit, file, inclusive lines, SHA-256 digest, stored code, destination,
item, and honest `exact` or `adapted` provenance in `data/agda-blocks*.json`.
If no source applies, record a gap and continue.

Make durable prose or notation repairs in converter code or versioned data,
regenerate every affected file, and add regression tests for recurring rules.

## Comments and validation

Add a short `codex` review comment only for a useful mathematical, source, or
dependency question. Do not record routine searches or passing checks.

Typecheck every changed section containing Agda:

```text
python3 rosetta.py typecheck-candidate N M
```

Before handoff run:

```text
python3 -m unittest discover
python3 rosetta.py check
git diff --check
```

Preserve unrelated work. Focused commits are allowed: inspect the worktree,
stage only task changes, validate, and use a clear message. Do not reset, clean,
overwrite, pull, push, or rewrite history unless the task requires it.
