# Section files

Section files are the project’s primary content and formalization priority.
Each corresponds to one LaTeX `\subsection`; its source ends at the next
`\subsection`, exercises environment, or source-file end.

Preserve the complete natural-language mathematics, order, item numbering,
proofs, references, and displays. Use `# Section N.M Title` and numbered
level-two item headings such as `## Definition N.M.K`. Let the converter emit
the module declaration and stable item markers.

For every definition, result, construction, or proof that needs formalization,
search pinned agda-unimath for exact and analogous code. Add only copied,
provenance-backed code with necessary local adaptations; never invent code.
Keep code beside its associated item and use only repository-local imports.

After changing a section, regenerate it, inspect the active output, run
`python3 rosetta.py typecheck-candidate N M` when it contains Agda, and run the
repository validation required by `AGENTS.md`.
